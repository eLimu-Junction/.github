Welcome to eLimu Junction, a platform aimed at improving data collection data management, and data use in education in Kenya. Our platform brings together students, teachers, school administrators, parents, and policy makers to create a collaborative environment that fosters learning and growth.

Our current focus is on the Mwalimu Central module, which is designed to simplify the generation of professional documents for teachers teaching the Competence Based Curriculum. We understand that the current process of handwriting these documents is time-consuming and cumbersome, and we aim to change that.

Mwalimu Central offers an easy-to-use platform that allows teachers to generate professional documents such as schemes of work, lesson plans, assessment rubrics, and records of work in just a few clicks. We have also included additional features such as student assessment reports, Individualised Educational Plans (IEP) for learners with special needs, and a self-evaluation form to facilitate personal appraisals, which are critical in growth and striving towards excellence.

Our mission is to make teaching and learning easier, exciting and more efficient for everyone involved in the education process. 

Join us on eLimu Junction and let's work together towards improving education in Kenya.
